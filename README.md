# AI_Final_Project_Matlab
The Aristo project at AI2 is focused on building such a system. One way Aristo "learns" is by extracting facts from various sources and processing them into a structured knowledge base. When taking an exam, questions are parsed and processed along with any accompanying diagrams to determine a strategy for answering. Aristo then uses entailment, statistical analysis, and inference methods to select a final answer.
While Aristo's abilities have improved significantly in the last two years, it still doesn't have perfect, reliable methods of gathering knowledge, understanding questions, or reasoning through answers.
Using a dataset of multiple choice question and answers from a standardized 8th grade science exam, AI2 is challenging you to create a model that gets to the head of the class.


We had four methods that we tried for our final project. First, we generated the code for random results with Java. After the random results, we used serious computations in Matlab, which are labeled “PROGRESS 1”. After this we tried to apply a neural network to our code. However, we were unable to make it work. Finally, we wrote a better serious computational code in Matlab. In this method we used a part of the theory from the article about deep learning. That article was called “Deep learning for answer sentence selection.” The second serious computational code is labeled “PROGESS 2”. We have detail descriptions of the classes made for both PROGRESS 1 and PROGRESS 2 below. 

Our results from random guessing were 0.25500. 
Our results from the first serious computation, PROGRESS 1, were 0.22500. 
Unfortunately we weren’t able to get a result from the code with the neural network because we couldn’t figure out how to make the code work.
Finally, our results from the second serious computation, PROGRESS 2, were 0.24000.
